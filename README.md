# Project to simulate NCAA Tournament with various bracket entries
Please view video preview, "simulatorPreview.mp4" (~50mb), for more information

## What this project does right now:
1. Allows users to fill out, save, and copy NCAA Tournament Challenge bracket entries.
2. Allows users to simulate\* the NCAA Tournament (up to 1,000 simulations at a time), scoring all saved entries in the process
3. For each saved bracket entry, allows users to view discrepancies between bracket entry and last 50 simulated outcomes.

 
\*Simulations are currently conducted using a simple linear model based on seed differential (i.e., a team playinng another team with same seed has a 50% chance of winning). Goal is to turn towards modeling/predictions after building out UI.
